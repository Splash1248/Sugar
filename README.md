# Gluco Vision

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Extracts PPG signals from video using color channels and region of interest.
- Applies **Butterworth bandpass** and **Savitzky-Golay smoothing** for noise reduction.
- Computes physiological features like **heart rate**, **entropy**, and **signal area**.
- Generates **synthetic glucose data** (normal + diabetic distributions).
- Combines real and synthetic data to train a **Gradient Boosting Regressor**.
- Outputs glucose prediction with simple risk level warnings.
